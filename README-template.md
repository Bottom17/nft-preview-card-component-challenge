## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was not very challenging but thanks to this project I got a deeper understanding of the ::before and ::after pseudo-classes.

```css
.app__info-equilibrium-wrapper:hover::after {
  content: url("/icon-view.svg");
  background-color: var(--clr-cyan-transparent);
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  border-radius: 8px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

In the next days my goal is to keep on doing relatively easy challenges in order to gain an in-depth knowledge of the relatively basic topics.

### Useful resources

- [Image hover state resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLDn_k8GmaU&t=2466s) - This video helped me achieve the hover state for the main image of the website (at around 1:27:28).
